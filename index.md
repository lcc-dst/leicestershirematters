Leicestershire Matters is sent to all residents in the county of Leicestershire. It costs around 9p to print and deliver each copy. To help save money on the distribution, we work closely with Royal Mail, though we're also keen to explore other ways of delivering these stories to you.

This is where this online version was born out of - experimenting with new channels and ways to share the latest stories from across the council with you. As a 'Beta' website, this area is likely to change and improve over time, so you're feedback is valuable in making sure it heads in the right direction. Spot something, or want to comment? - [email us your feedback](mailto:Leics.Matters@leics.gov.uk?Subject=Leicestershire%20Matters%20-%20digital%20feedback)

> We want older and vulnerable people to be independent, to get support within communities, and to get value for money services

## Let's talk about the future

It’s a pretty stark message, but people need to start thinking about their future housing plans.
Preparing for the needs of our ageing population is one of the greatest challenges facing councils – and we’re urging people to plan ahead.

 Understandably, many people want to stay at home. The size of a property and its location can be challenging – but last year, through equipment and support, we helped 7,000 remain independent at home.

‘Extra care’ housing allows people to live as independently as possible, with the reassurance of support with personal care when needed – and we’re rolling it out across Leicestershire.

Following the success of Oak Court in Blaby, we’re investing over £1.5 million in a big development in Loughborough. Waterside Court on Derby Road is an £11m project providing 62 flats. Being built in partnership with East Midlands Housing, it’s due to open by the end of this year.

Councillor Richard Blunt, cabinet member for adult social care, said: “Supporting older and vulnerable people must come first, and that’s why we’re investing over half the council’s budget in adult social care.
“It’s so important for people, perhaps those in their 50s and 60s, to start thinking now about where they’re going to live in the future. Often, people have to make these choices at a time of crisis – having these conversations now can set the ball rolling.”

### Here’s how we are tackling adult social care:
- We spend 38 per cent of our overall budget (around £130m net per year) on adult social care, which is higher than the average for similar authorities
- We're expecting to spend more on supporting people with learning disabilities

### What we’ve done:
- Advised 19,000 people in 2016-17 about support available
- Helped 7,000 people to be independent, through equipment or support
- Assisted 3,500 people to regain skills and live independently
- Supported 3,000 carers

### What we’re doing:
- Jointly working with the emh group on new extra care housing at Waterside Court, Loughborough
- Developing more independent living and short break opportunities for people with disabilities
- Working with partners in the NHS and district councils around housing support and technology to help them in the home
- Supporting people in the community through new day and mental health services


## Online help to stay healthy and independent
An online information hub is helping residents stay fit, healthy and independent.

![First contact plus]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/R0309-Social-Care-FCP-web.jpg)

First Contact offers information about support with health, falls, feeling safe, living independently, debts and benefits, work, learning and volunteering, and families and relationships, plus links to organisations.

[Visit first contact plus](http://www.firstcontactplus.org.uk/){:.button.special}

Residents who are in need of extra help can use the 'self-referral' button to arrange for an adviser to call them to discuss their specific needs, and put them in touch with the right people for support.

## Getting home and staying well

Ensuring patients can be cared for at home, and return home as quickly as possible following a hospital stay, is a priority for the council.
We’re working closely with the NHS on plans across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland to make health and care services sustainable for the future.
We know that being at home with the right support is the best way for people to stay well. Evidence shows that people who are in hospital for more than 10 days are less likely to be able to go home and be as independent as they were. Doctors estimate that for older people, 10 days bed rest can be the equivalent of 10 years muscle wastage. Therefore it is vitally important that people leave hospital and go home as quickly as possible once their treatment is completed.
Across the county, health and care providers are working together to develop new services that will support the vision of ‘home first’.
Over the next few months new services and ways of working will be introduced. One initiative being trialled is a joined-up team to help people coming out of hospital. Health and care workers are currently based in some of the busiest wards at Leicester Royal Infirmary to provide expert advice to ward staff. This is helping to get people home as soon as they are well enough.

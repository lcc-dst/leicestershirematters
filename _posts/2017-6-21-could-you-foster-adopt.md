> A rallying call for people to consider becoming foster carers and adopters is being made.

We urgently need people to come forward and open their hearts and homes to children and young people across the county.

There are children in our care, including babies, school aged children, teenagers, sibling groups and disabled youngsters, who need people to offer them loving homes in Leicestershire.

We’re asking for anyone who is interested in fostering and adoption to contact us and find out more - or come along to our regular information events.

Councillor Ivan Ould, cabinet member for children and families, said: “Fostering or adopting a child can really transform lives, for both the young person, and the carer.

“Many people rule themselves out as they worry they don’t meet the ‘criteria’, but the reality is they probably do.
“We offer complete support to all our adopters and foster carers, including bespoke training, get-togethers, newsletters and the opportunity to attend local forums with other carers.”

## A fostering story

Trish said:  “I love children and I knew, through raising my own children and looking after those we cared for, this is what my life is was meant to be.”  In total, they’ve cared for 211 children including sibling pairs, a parent and child placed together, teenagers and young children with serious medical conditions.

Trish added: “Where children have gone on to be adopted, some of their adopted parents have stayed in touch and sent photos. We’ve even met some of them recently.

“As you can imagine we get Christmas cards in the hundreds. Fostering is rewarding, but it is not always an easy ride. It is hard to say goodbye, you’ve got to love the children and give a little bit of yourself to them.  "It is fantastic to see them settled and enjoying life with their new families."

>Budgets are becoming increasingly stretched, but supporting Leicestershire’s booming economy remains a top priority.

More and more companies are making the county their home, bringing jobs and putting Leicestershire at the heart of industry and innovation.

The city and county are great places to live and do business, and we work very closely with the Local Enterprise Partnership, and Leicester City Council, to support the economy across both areas.

And by working together with the Government, we want to devolve powers and money so that we can take decisions locally - particularly over planning for housing, economic development and skills and transport infrastructure.
Businesses need reliable, fit-for-the-future communications. That’s why we’ve put more than £33m into superfast broadband – 97 per cent of residents can access the network and we’re rolling it out to the remaining 13,000 properties. By the end of 2017, we’re on course to bring high-speed fibre technology to more than 82,000 premises.

Companies also want quality premises and we’ve developed a number of high-spec industrial units. By bringing new life to old commercial sites, we’re making it attractive for businesses to set up shop in Leicestershire. Airfield Farm and Leaders Farm in Harborough are already thriving sites and more are on the way.

### <a class="icon fa-lightbulb-o"> SAVING ENERGY
Rolling out LED street lights is saving £2 million – and solar panels, LED lights and a bio-mass boiler in our buildings is reducing our yearly energy bills by £420,000. We’re also helping other councils, NHS, police, fire and other public sector organisations to cut costs and carbon emissions by making changes.

### <a class="icon fa-car"> SPEED CAMERAS
We’re calling on the government to let us use fines to fund speed cameras in seven communities. A pilot scheme launches this autumn to see if they can help to tackle the daily effects of speeding motorists. But, funding the scheme is key and we’re thinking differently about securing income.


### <a class="icon fa-home"> COUNCIL TAX
If district councils upped council tax collection rates and improved forecasting, it could generate an extra £6.3 million a year for public sector services. Council leader Nick Rushton has called on district council leaders to support a review: “If we overhauled the system – and had one way of collecting council tax, we’d save money and increase the amount raised  for vital council, police and fire services.”

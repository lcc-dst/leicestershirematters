>A new stop smoking service has already helped more than 600 people kick the habit. Below, Lynn from Whitwick explains the difference it has made to her life.

Recently-published figures also show that the number of county smokers has fallen significantly since 2012. Back then, the  figure was estimated at 19.3 per cent of the county population, it now stands at 13.5 per cent.

Councillor Ernie White, cabinet member for health, said: “We’re very encouraged by the figures but we’re not complacent. We want to carry on supporting people through our free QuitReady service.” In the first six months since the service was launched in January 2017, QuitReady helped more than 600 people to give up.

## My story

**When Lynn lost her mum to lung disease that was her trigger to quit smoking**

“When my mum passed away it made me realise how precious life is and it was a massive factor in me giving up,” said 48-year-old Lynn from Whitwick, who has been supported by QuitReady. “It’s been more than six months since I quit and I never think about having a cigarette. It’s been brilliant.”

Lynn said that the health of her grandson also contributed to her decision to quit: “He has been diagnosed with a serious heart condition, but he’s beaten the odds and he’s doing great. I want to spend time with him and the rest of the family – that’s so important to me.”

Lynn praised the support she has received from the QuitReady team: “The service has been great. It really suits me that it’s not appointment based. I’m a full time carer and it can be really difficult to find time to make appointments, so it’s brilliant that I can ring my advisor at any time for support if it’s needed.”

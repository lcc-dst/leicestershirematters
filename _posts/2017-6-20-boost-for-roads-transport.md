> Leicestershire has ambitious plans to grow the economy and boost jobs – and we’re investing in our roads to support this.

Work is underway to ensure the county’s road network can support growth by managing more vehicles. Easing congestion is a top priority – because it can cause unreliable journey times and harm the economy.

We have road and transport projects worth £355 million on the way, some of which have already secured funding. Each is designed to support growth and boost the local economy.

We’ve recently opened the £15 million M1 bridge at Lubbesthorpe, which spans the motorway, linking a new development to work and school, and reducing congestion on Beggars Lane between Leicester Forest East and Enderby.

We have applied for funding towards £7.8 million improvements to the busy A46, A5630 and Anstey Lane roundabout near Anstey. More traffic is expected here because of the Ashton Green development which is creating more than 3,000 homes and 9,000 jobs.
We have also bid for £17 million of government funding to turn parts of the A512 into Loughborough (close to M1 junction 23)into a dual carriageway.

These plans include a new roundabout for two large housing and employment developments. The developments provide 4,000 homes and 5,700 jobs.

Cabinet member for highways, Councillor Blake Pain welcomes the investment: “Business is on the up in Leicestershire and our population is increasing. And by working with developers and other partners, we’ve successfully secured funding from government to support this.

“Our £355 million package of improvements aims to reduce congestion, support business productivity and help people get to work or college. What links them together is that they have the local economy – our homes, jobs and communities – at their heart.”

As well as these major investments, we want to make sure that people make everyday choices about their travel options. As part of our successful ‘choose how you move’ campaign, we’re raising awareness of travel options to work and school.

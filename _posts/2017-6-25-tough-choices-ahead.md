> It has been tough and it’s getting even tougher – that’s the latest budget message, making fair funding essential.

Leicestershire remains the lowest-funded county council in the country. If it was funded at the same level as Surrey, it would be £104 million per year better off.

Real progress has been made in our fight for reform, with the government agreeing that a consultation is needed. But with a growing and ageing population ramping up demands on services, it’s clear we need to step up our call for change.
Deputy council leader Byron Rhodes said: “The council will spend nearly £350 million this year.  More than half of this goes on services which support adults, children and families who really need our help.

“Low funding remains our Achilles’ heel. Pressure could be eased by fair funding and we’ve drawn up a model which allocates money in a more just way. Now is the time to bring in a new approach, based on need, and make fair funding a reality.”

Several factors are increasing demand. By 2037, the number of over 80s is set to double and Leicestershire’s population expected to grow by 13 per cent. Between 2010 and 2010, spend on road maintenance will halve, and each year, the number of children in care is rising by eight per cent.

Coun Rhodes continued:  “The good news is that we’ve planned ahead. We don’t produce annual budgets which only provide a quick fix – we take a much longer view.

“Since 2010, we’ve been able to reduce costs by £166 million.  But with a further £66 million to save, £23 million of which unidentified, balancing the books is harder than ever. Without fair funding, we could be cutting to the bone of public services.  

“The future of local services will depend on achieving our cost-cutting plans, driving up income through council tax collection and commercial opportunities, and seeking a fair share from government.

“If there are other or additional solutions to our funding crisis, we also need to look carefully at them.”
